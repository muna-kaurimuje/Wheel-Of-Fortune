 Wheel-Of-Fortune--Basic wheel spinning 2D game coded in C#. All scripting and visual design elements are completely original.
 In addition to enhancing my game development and C# scripting abilities, this project has taught me fundamental design techniques.
 The wheel was designed in Blender and was finalised in Adobe Photoshop. 
 The game was developed in the Unity game engine.
